# Collections-in-Java

Collection: This is the root interface of the collection hierarchy. It defines the basic methods that all collections will have, such as add, remove, and contains.

List: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. It extends the Collection interface and provides methods for positional access, searching, and iteration.

Set: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. It is implemented by various classes like HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.

Map: An object that maps keys to values. It cannot contain duplicate keys, and each key can map to at most one value. Popular implementations are HashMap, LinkedHashMap, and TreeMap.

Queue: A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. It typically follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. Common implementations include LinkedList and PriorityQueue.

ArrayList: A commonly used implementation of the List interface that uses a dynamically resizable array to store elements.

LinkedList: Another implementation of the List interface that uses a doubly linked list to store elements.

HashSet: An implementation of the Set interface that uses a hash table to store elements, allowing for constant-time average lookup.

LinkedHashSet: Similar to HashSet, but maintains the order of insertion using a linked list.

TreeSet: An implementation of the Set interface that stores elements in a sorted order. It uses a Red-Black tree internally.

HashMap: An implementation of the Map interface that stores key-value pairs in a hash table.

LinkedHashMap: Similar to HashMap, but maintains the order of insertion using a linked list.

TreeMap: An implementation of the Map interface that stores key-value pairs in a sorted order. It uses a Red-Black tree internally.

PriorityQueue: An implementation of the Queue interface that maintains its elements in a priority order.

These are just some of the classes and interfaces in the Java Collections framework. Each of these classes provides different methods and features for working with collections of data. The framework is a fundamental part of Java programming and is widely used for tasks that involve managing groups of objects efficiently.
